# Crypto Currency Tracker

This is a project for the NM assesment that is a fullstack application that uses my backend as an api to fetch cryptocurrency data from
[CoinMarketCapAPI](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for the assesment. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing
From NMAssesment-master
```
cd server 
npm install
npm run dev
```
Running this command will take a bit and may show an intial crash because it is npm installing for you through the scripts :) just give it about a minute and it should be working fine
